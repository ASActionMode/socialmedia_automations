(C) AS ActionMode 2024

**THIS EXTENSION IS BASED ON FACEBOOK AUTOMATION EXTENSION**
*I created this script because that extension was only specially designed for Facebook. I might merge both later.*
*Also there were more things to be changed for that extension to work on Instagram, it requires a lot of debugging & testing. It's already done so yeah! :)*

## Install process will be same for both scripts after all.

# First Method: Extension (Easy)

1. To use this method you need to go to [https://download-directory.github.io/](https://download-directory.github.io/)
2. And Paste [ https://github.com/ASActionMode/socialmedia_automations/edit/main/instagram](https://github.com/ASActionMode/socialmedia_automations/edit/main/instagram) In the Box.
3. Wait a few seconds, and the folder inside the ZIP file will be downloaded.
4. Unzip/Extract the .zip folder into an Empty folder. (Create a new or use an existing empty folder of your choice.)

### Step 2:

1. Head to your Browser.
2. Click on the Three dots in the corner of the Browser window.
3. Click "Extensions" and then "Manage extensions"
4. Here you'll need to enable the "Developer Mode": To do that click on the Toggle at the right corner of your screen. Saying "Developer mode"
5. After enabling Developer mode, you'll get three new options, "Load unpacked", "Pack extension" and "Update".
6. Click on "Load unpacked" and head to the Folder where the files you've extracted from ZIP are located. Select that folder after that click "Select folder"

   (Make sure you're logged into the Facebook.)
9. Click on "Start" to start it, "Pause" to pause it, "Resume" to resume it, and "Stop" to stop it.
10. A browser prompt will pop up
10.1: It would ask you what you want to do.
(Accept Friend Requests / Send Friend Requests / Both)
10.2: It will ask you how many total requests you want to send/accept.
10.3: It will ask you how many requests you want to increase the delay.
10.4: It will ask you, what should be your initial delay (Normal delay, whatever you enter here, the script will start with that delay)
10.5: It will ask you what should be your Increased Delay.
11. The script should start doing its actions.

# Second Method: Use Script Manually (Medium)

Go to [https://github.com/ASActionMode/socialmedia_automations/edit/main/instagram](https://github.com/ASActionMode/socialmedia_automations/edit/main/instagram) 

Copy JavaScript file **"content.js's"** All contents.

To use this method, you need to:
1. Open the Facebook page where you want to accept/send friend requests. It should be [https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/suggested/](https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/suggested/)
2. Open the Inspect window, head to the console (F12 / Ctrl + Shift + I), and paste the code. Press enter.
3. A browser prompt will pop up
3.1: It would ask you what you want to do.
(Accept Friend Requests / Send Friend Requests / Both)
3.2: It will ask you how many total requests you want to send/accept.
3.3: It will ask you how many requests you want to increase the delay.
3.4: It will ask you, what should be your initial delay (Normal delay, whatever you enter here, the script will start with that delay)
3.5: It will ask you what should be your Increased Delay.
4. The script should start doing its actions.

Additional functions, type these on the console window to perform these actions:
pauseScript() - Pauses the script at its current progress.
resumeScript() - Type this to resume the script after you pause it on its current progress.
stopScript() - Permanently Stops the script and it cannot be resumed once its stopped.


Make sure there are profiles or buttons on the page.
Like if you want to accept requests there should be requests on your current page.
If you want to send requests, there should be an Add Friend button to send requests on your current page.
Then you can rest assured script will complete your task and then stop automatically.
You can see the progress in the console.
